ETL offset tries to optimize with the current ETL_amplitude. 
Set it to zero before optimizing? 
If ETL amplitude is completely unknown, set it to 0 and use the central ROI (as in manual mode).
If a ball-park ETL amplitude is known, use it and optimize on entire image.

In this approach, ETL offset found is close to beam-parked manually found parameters

Reset ETL amplitude to initial, non-zero value before optimizing it.
Make sure there are no negative values in the search grid.

ETL amplitude found (after optimizing ETL_offset) 
is sometimes lower than the manually determined value,
and the sides of the LS are thus more blurred.
For etl amplitude, optimizer can be as good as manual, if ROI is horizontal,
so that left-right axis is more emphasized.
However, on chicken sample, these differences are really hard to spot by eye.

Optimizer works OK in scattering galvo-frozen regime, if ROI is horizontal and narrow around the beam.

In summury, 
- optimizer works much better than expert human on autofocus, using either entire image or ROI
- for ETL parameters, optimizer works well if ROI is chosen reasonably, 
but tends to underperform human expert who calibrates ETL parameters in scattering, galvo-frozen regime.
